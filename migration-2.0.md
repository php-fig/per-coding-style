# Migrating from PER-CS v1.0 (PSR-12) to PER-CS v2.0 ###

## Summary

PER-CS is the next evolution of the PSR set of Coding Standards from the
PHP-FIG (Framework Interoperability Group). It extends the Coding Standards
laid out in PSR-12 to the newest functionality added to PHP such as the match
keyword, enums, attributes, and more.

This document describes the changes and additions on a section by section
basis between PER-CS v2.0 and PER-CS v1.0 (which is a direct equivalent of 
PSR12 with very minor changes).

It is derived in part from [a GitHub-generated diff](https://github.com/php-fig/per-coding-style/compare/1.0.0...2.0.0#files_bucket)
and focuses on the changes on a section-by-section basis as its focus is to be more readable.

This document intends to provide a summary of these changes that can
then be used to drive action lists for toolset producers to support PER-CS v2.0.

This document is non-normative.  The published [2.0 PER-CS](https://www.php-fig.org/per/coding-style/) specification 
is the canonical source for the PER-CS formatting expectations.

## [Section 2.6 - Trailing Commas](https://www.php-fig.org/per/coding-style/#26-trailing-commas)

Numerous constructs now allow a sequence of values to have an optional trailing
comma:
 * If the final item is on the same line then there MUST NOT be a trailing comma
 * If the final item is not on the same line then there MUST be a trailing comma

```php
<?php
$sequence = [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13];

function beep(
    string $a,
    string $b,
    string $c,
) {
    // ...
}
```

## [Section 4.4 - Methods and Functions](https://www.php-fig.org/per/coding-style/#44-methods-and-functions)

If a function or method contains no statements or comments (such as an empty
no-op implementation or when using constructor property promotion), then the
body SHOULD be abbreviated as {} and placed on the same line as the previous
symbol, separated by a space.
So, for a method of a subclass that does nothing:

```php
<?php
class SubClass extends BaseClass
{
    protected function init() {}
}
```

## [Section 4.6 - Modifier Keywords](https://www.php-fig.org/per/coding-style/#46-modifier-keywords)

Modifier keywords are keywords that alter how PHP handles classes,
properties and methods.

These keywords MUST BE ordered as follows:

[abstract|final] [public|protected|private] [static] [readonly] [type] name

```php
<?php
namespace Vendor\Package;

abstract class ClassName
{
    protected static readonly string $foo;

    final protected int $beep;

    abstract protected function zim();

    final public static function bar()
    {
        // method body
    }
}
```

Furthermore, all keywords must be on a single line and MUST be separated
by a single space.

## [Section 4.7 - Method and Function Calls](https://www.php-fig.org/per/coding-style/#47-method-and-function-calls)

If using named arguments, there MUST NOT be a space between the argument name and the colon, 
and there MUST be a single space between the colon and the argument value.

```php
<?php
somefunction($a, b: $b, c: 'c');
```

Method chaining MAY be put on separate lines, where each subsequent line is indented once. When doing so, the first method MUST be on the next line.

```php
<?php
$someInstance
    ->create()
    ->prepare()
    ->run();
```

## [Section 4.8 - Function Callable References](https://www.php-fig.org/per/coding-style/#48-function-callable-references)

Function callable references - there must not be whitespace surrounding the '...' operator ()

```php
<?php
$callable = $item->doSomething(...);
```

## [Section 5.2 - Switch, Case, Match](https://www.php-fig.org/per/coding-style/#52-switch-case-match)

The match keyword is now covered.

```php
<?php
$result = match ($a) {
    'foo' => 'Foo',
    'bar' => 'Bar',
    default => 'Baz',
};
```

```php
<?php
$returnValue = match ($expr) {
    0 => 'First case',
    1, 2, 3 => multipleCases(),
    default => 'Default case',
};
```

## [Section 7.1 - Short Closures](https://www.php-fig.org/per/coding-style/#71-short-closures)

A new subsection about Short Closures, as per the link above. Example as follows:

```php
<?php
$func = fn(int $x, int $y): int => $x + $y;

$func = fn(int $x, int $y): int
    => $x + $y;

$func = fn(
    int $x,
    int $y,
): int
    => $x + $y;

$result = $collection->reduce(fn(int $x, int $y): int => $x + $y, 0);
```

## [Section 9 - Enumerations](https://www.php-fig.org/per/coding-style/#9-enumerations)

Enums are now covered, as per the link above. Please see below for examples.

```php
<?php
enum Suit: string
{
    case Hearts = 'H';
    case Diamonds = 'D';
    case Clubs = 'C';
    case Spades = 'S';
}
```

```php
<?php
enum Size
{
    case Small;
    case Medium;
    case Large;

    public const Huge = self::Large;
}
```

## [Section 10 - Heredoc and Nowdoc](https://www.php-fig.org/per/coding-style/#10-heredoc-and-nowdoc)

This is a new section about Heredoc and Nowdoc notation as per the link above.
Example follows:

```php
<?php
function allowed()
{
    $allowedHeredoc = <<<COMPLIANT
        This
        is
        a
        compliant
        heredoc
        COMPLIANT;

    $allowedNowdoc = <<<'COMPLIANT'
        This
        is
        a
        compliant
        nowdoc
        COMPLIANT;

    var_dump(
        'foo',
        <<<'COMPLIANT'
            This
            is
            a
            compliant
            parameter
            COMPLIANT,
        'bar',
    );
}
```

## [Section 11 - Arrays](https://www.php-fig.org/per/coding-style/#11-arrays)

This is a new section about arrays, as per the link above.
Example as follows:

```php
<?php
$arr1 = ['single', 'line', 'declaration'];
$arr2 = [
    'multi',
    'line',
    'declaration',
    ['values' => 1, 5, 7],
    [
        'nested',
        'array',
    ],
];
```

## [Section 12 - Attributes](https://www.php-fig.org/per/coding-style/#12-attributes)

This is a new section, as per the above link.
The following is an example of valid usage.

    private Foo $foo;

    public function __construct(
        #[Load(context: 'foo', bar: true)]
        private readonly FooService $fooService,

        #[LoadProxy(context: 'bar')]
        private readonly BarService $barService,
    ) {}

    /**
    * Sets the foo.
    */
    #[Poink('narf'), Narf('poink')]
    public function setFoo(#[Beep] Foo $new): void
    {
        // ...
    }

    #[Complex(
        prop: 'val',
        other: 5,
    )]
    #[Other, Stuff]
    #[Here]
    public function complicated(
        string $a,

        #[Decl]
        string $b,

        #[Complex(
            prop: 'val',
            other: 5,
